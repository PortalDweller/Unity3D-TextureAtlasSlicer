Works very well to import [Kenney's sprite assets](http://opengameart.org/users/kenney)!

# Installation

## In the form of a unity module

Installation as a unity module via a git link in the PackageManager or direct editing of `Packages/manifest.json` is supported:

```
"com.portaldweller.textureatlasslicer.unity" : "https://github.com/PortalDweller/Unity3D-TextureAtlasSlicer",
```

## Usage
- You can now use the Assets/Slice Sprite Using XML button!
- This will open a window.
- Select any sprite asset in your Project window
- If it has a XML file with the same name next to it, that XML file will automatically be selected
- Otherwise, drag-drop the XML file reference onto the XML Source field in the Texture Atlas Slicer window
- Configure the pivot settings
- Hit Slice!
- Enjoy! :D
